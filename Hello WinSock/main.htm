    Dynamic memory
This header describes functions used to manage dynamic storage in C++.

Exceptionally within the standard library, this header declares several functions in the global namespace instead of within the std namespace: These are the operator overloads for operator new and operator delete, which handle dynamic storage requests. Some of these functions have also the special property of being implicitly declared and replaceable.

The header also defines some specific types and the set_new_handler / get_new_handler pair of functions:

Functions
operator new
Allocate storage space (function )
operator new[]
Allocate storage space for array (function )
operator delete
Deallocate storage space (function )
operator delete[]
Deallocate storage space of array (function )
set_new_handler
Set new handler function (function )
get_new_handler 
Get new handler function (function )

Types
nothrow_t
Nothrow type (type )
new_handler
Type of new handler function (type )
bad_alloc
Exception thrown on failure allocating memory (class )
bad_array_new_length 
Exception on bad array length (class )

Constants
nothrow
